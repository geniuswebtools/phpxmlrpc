<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the homepage of "XML-RPC for PHP". It is a library implementing the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> protocol, written in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>. It is also known as PHPXMLRPC.<br/>
It is designed for ease of use, flexibility and completeness. High speed and reduced memory footprint are not the main goals of the project.
</p>
<p>Note that this is not <a href="http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/">the library</a> which can be compiled as a <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/xmlrpc">php extension</a> and has been bundled with php from version 4.1 up to version 7.4.<br/>
This is also not the same library as <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/XML_RPC/">the one</a> that is part of PEAR, either. They both share a common ancestry, since the PEAR version is a branch of the original phpxmlrpc library, later independently maintained.</p>

<h2><a name="features">Main Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for creating both xmlrpc clients and servers</li>
<li>Fully automated or fully manual, fine-grained encoding and decoding from php values to xmlrpc</li>
<li>Support for UTF8, Latin-1 and ASCII character encodings. With the php mbstring extension enabled, even more character sets are supported</li>
<li>Support for http features including compression of both requests and responses, cookies, proxies, basic and digest auth, ntlm auth, https, http2, keepalives (some only with the php cURL extension)</li>
<li>Optional validation of parameter types of incoming xmlrpc request</li>
<li>Support for `system.listMethods`, `system.methodHelp`, `system.multicall` and `system.getCapabilities` methods</li>
<li>Support for the &lt;NIL/&gt; and &lt;EX:NIL/&gt; extensions to xmlrpc</li>
<li>Possibility to register existing php function or class methods as webservices, extracting value-added information from phpdoc comments</li>
<li>A web based visual debugger is included with the library</li>
<li>A package emulating the API of the native XML-RPC extension for PHP, built on this library, is available at <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/polyfill-xmlrpc">https://github.com/gggeek/polyfill-xmlrpc</a></li>
<!--<li>Many other cool features are delivered with the 'Extras' package, such as a complete emulation layer of php native xmlrpc calls, an xmlrpc server that generates html documentation of exposed webservices, and a complete jsonrpc library...</li>
<li>Last but not least, <a href="http://gggeek.github.io/jsxmlrpc/">a version of the library</a> implementing the same API in Javascript is available, allowing to leverage acquired knowledge to easily build ajax/dhtml clients</li>-->
</ul>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3.0 or later; 7.4 or later recommended</li>
<li>the php "curl" extension is needed if you wish to use SSL or HTTP 1.1 to communicate with remote servers</li>
<li>the php "mbstring" extension is needed to allow reception of requests/responses in character sets other than ASCII, Latin-1, UTF-8</li>
<li>the php "xmlrpc" native extension is not required, but if it is installed, there will be no interference with the operation of this library</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="interest">Documentation</a></h2>
<h3>User manual</h3>
<p>
A proper user manual for version 4 is not yet available; for the moment the <a href="doc-4/api/index.html">API docs</a> will have to do.<br/>
A good way to get started with API usage is to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/tree/master/demo">demo source code</a>, showcasing both Client and Server use cases.
</p>
<p>
Manuals for older versions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/blob/master/doc/api_changes_v4.md">API changes between version 3 and version 4</a></li>
<li>User manual for version 3, in <a href="doc-2/">HTML</a> or <a href="doc-2/xmlrpc_php.pdf">PDF</a> format.<br/>
For the adventurous there is even an <a href="doc-2/xmlrpc_php.xml">xml+css</a> version (note: better viewing results obtained by Firefox and Opera users)</li>
<li><a href="doc-1.1/">User manual for version 1.2.1</a></li>
<li><a href="doc/">User manual for version 1.0.99</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Changelogs</h3>
Detailed release notes are <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/releases">available on GitHub</a> for all releases starting with 2.2.2.<br/>
A changelog for very old versions, before the introduction of git (ie. up to version 2.2.2), is distributed as part of the source code. It is also <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc/blob/master/doc/ChangeLog">available online</a>.

<h2><a name="demoserver">Online demo server</a></h2>
<p>A demo server is active at the address <b>https://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/xmlrpc/demo/server/server.php</b>. It exposes functions that can be used for interoperability testing (the full code for the server is included in the Git version of the library).<br/>
<!--You can see the source code here: <a href="https://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/xmlrpc/demo/server/server.php?showSource=TRUE">https://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/server.php</a> (the xmlrpc server will activate on POST requests, and display its API on GET requests), and auto-generated documentation <a href="server.php">here</a>--></p>

<h2><a name="debugger">Online xmlrpc debugger</a></h2>
<p>A demo xmlrpc debugger application, built on top of this library, is active at the address <a href="https://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/xmlrpc/debugger/">https://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/xmlrpc/debugger/</a>.
You can use the debugger to e.g. query the demo server, or debug your own personal xmlrpc server, if it is accessible on the net.</p>
